#summary These are my notes on attempting to utilize the VideoCore OpenVG interface on the RaspberryPi. This could be great for an ATEM which has multiple HDMI ports. It could used as a more powerful media player.

= Installing OpenVG =

Update RaspberryPi firmware. Type:
{{{
sudo apt-get install rpi-update
sudo rpi-update
}}}

Update apt-get too. Type:
{{{
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}
This will likely take a while 30+ minutes.

The GPU needs to have more [http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Troubleshooting#Choosing_the_right_ARM.2FGPU_memory_split more memory] than is dynamically allocated to it by default.  Edit the RaspberryPi's configuration:
{{{
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
}}}
... and, add the following line to the bottom the file:
{{{
gpu_mem=128
}}}
Save and exit.

You will have to reboot for the above steps to take affect.
{{{
sudo reboot
}}}

[https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/opt/vc/src/hello_pi Example code] should be available in /opt/vc/src/hello_pi/.
{{{
ls /opt/vc/src/hello_pi
}}}

Install necessary dependencies:
{{{
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev libfreetype6-dev git indent
}}}

{{{
git clone git://github.com/czechtech/openvg
cd openvg
make library
sudo make install
cd ..
}}}

Test the library:
{{{
cd openvg/client
make test
}}}
At the end of the demo, it will display the website of the library.  Press the enter key to terminate.
{{{
cd ../..
}}}
